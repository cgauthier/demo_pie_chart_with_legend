# demo_pie_chart_with_legend
HTML 5 / JS Pie Chart using Canvas / CSS  calculations and more.


    The purpose of this code sample is 
    to demonstrate how to create a pie chart
    and provide a legend inside of it

    The code below is not optimized as production quality
    It is only meant to demonstrate how to code the solution.

    Of the following goals being accomplished:
    
    1) create a data-driven pie chart using HTML Canvas
    2) use HEX color to generate a tooltip for the Canvas (as a title attribute)
    3) Provide a 1% buffer for slices where the percentage is less than 1%
    4) add the legend of the pie chart in the middle (it mimicks a donut chart)
    5) CSS is used for calculations
    6) pull CSS var values to generate to set the canvas width and height and to set colors for data array
    7) fake a tooltip scheme based on canvas title attribute and the ability to pull color from mouse position
